# mold #

It really grows on you.

``mold`` is yet another configuration management tool.  However, we
make no claim that ``mold`` is the best configuration management
tool.  It will be able to do the job of configuration management,
but one of the main goals in making ``mold`` is to create a set of
standards that all configuration management tools can follow.  If
other tools adopt these standards (or any standards at all), even 
if no one uses ``mold``, the project will have been a success.


# Quickstart #

Make a virtual environment (no, this isn't necessary, but it sure
is nice):

    XXX test this
    virtualenv moldtest
    source moldtest/bin/activate


Get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/iffy/mold.git XXX


Install dependencies:

    pip install Twisted Jinja2 jsonschema


Install ``mold``:

    cd mold.git
    python setup.py install


Inspect the state of a file:

    mold inspect file setup.py


Learn what else you can do by reading the docs XXX


# Goals #

1. A major goal of ``mold`` is to standardize configuration 
management.  As such, JSON and JSON schema are used extensively.

2. Another goal of ``mold`` is to not depend on a single programming
language.  If you're familiar with ruby, you should be able to write
stuff in ruby.  Likewise for Python, Erlang, Clojure, FORTRAN, 
etc...  This modular, language-agnostic ability is achieved by
using well-defined JSON schemas and keeping components simple.

3. A third goal of ``mold`` is to stay out of the way.  You should
always be able to see everything that's happening on your machine.
You get all the standard in, out and error, the environment settings
when things run, log files generated by commands -- all of it.
